a) Difficulty Adjustment (the most important):
   - If the player's win rate is very low or they are on a losing streak, choose an easier opponent.
   - If the player’s win rate is high or they are on a winning streak, choose a stronger opponent.
   - Overall, try to make the player wins, but still challenging.

b) Opponent Diversity:
   - Prefer an agent type and character that the player has not yet faced or has faced only a few times.
   - Rotate among different play styles (defensive, projectile-heavy, rushdown, etc.) so the player experiences variety.

c) Player Behaviors:
   - If the player rarely uses special moves (e.g., < 2 per match), assume they are a beginner and avoid overwhelming them with advanced AI.
   - If the player often uses combos or advanced techniques, they are more skilled; pick a challenging agent to maintain fun.

d). Agent/Character Features:
   - When possible, select agents that demonstrate distinct strategies (e.g., projectile spamming, grappling, or strong aerial attacks).
   - Avoid repeatedly using the same type/character unless necessary for balancing difficulty.

e). CONSIDER PLAYER'S FEEDBACK!: 
   LAST BUT　NOT LEAST，IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT!
   Check "player's_feedback" and "the_last_opponents" in the provided playing_data dictionary. 
   If they provided any feedbackm, consider how they feel and what they suggest.
